hand, since diagonal element m exceed 1, diagonal element (m-i) ca1mot exceed zero. hence, respective diagonal off-diagonal elements sign must equal zero, follows corresponding diagonal clemcnts m must equal one, meaning off-diagonal elements two rows must zero (since elements row ca1mot sum unity) thus elements two rows (m-i) must zero. explanation second condition now hand; holds if, if, diagonal element matrix m equal one, meaning sector corresponding row question makes purchases additional money income solely within itself. aside umealistic, situation means imports can determined without taking offending sector account. therefore merely eliminate particular row column m, reduce vectors accordingly. (the existence sector may still noticeable fact mar­ ginal propensities purchase one remaining sectors may add one, thus violating earlier assumption; moreover, imports time will add amount credit
